========

Several years ago I wanted to learn Erlang but really didn't have any
projects to apply it to.  I did a little searching and stumbled
across Flying Frog Consultancy's Ray Tracer.

I didn't know OCaml and C++ wasn't my strongest language but between
the two I got something to work. Thanx FFC for the help.
